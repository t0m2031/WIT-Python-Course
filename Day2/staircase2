You are given a staircase with n steps. This means that you can 
go from bottom to top in n steps. Write a function that counts
the number of ways you can go from bottom to top
Note that you can take one or three or five steps at a time.

Sample testcase:
n = 2
Sample Output:
1

Explaination:
Only way - 0 -> 1 -> 2 (One step at a time)


Sample testcase 1:
n = 1
Sample Output 1:
1

Explaination:
Only way - 0 -> 1 (One step at a time)

More Examples:
n = 3
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
0 -> 3

n = 4
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
0 -> 3 -> 4
0 -> 1 -> 4
